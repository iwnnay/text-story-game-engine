# TSGE
## Text Story Game Engine

This is a game engine designed to work with most modern JavaScript front-end frameworks
and node.js.

# Installation
Still working on this, don't have it installed anywhere yet. Not even sure how
it's done.

# What it can do
At the moment... it can display some text. Yes, that's it. For now.

# Roadmap
Here's where I declare my lofty goals for this side project of mine and hope
it actually gets there.

1. Can look around a room
1. Can type in a command and interact with a single object
1. Can add items to an inventory
1. Can use an item from your inventory on an object

That would be a pretty great start at this point. The end goal would be
to create a multiplayer world where you can walk around and discover a world/story
to a creator's whimsy.
